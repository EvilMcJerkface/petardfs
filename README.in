petardfs is a FUSE filesystem designed to hoist your applications with errors.
With no configuration petardfs takes a base filesystem and exposes it through FUSE.
An XML configuration file is used to tell petardfs which files to report errors
for and what error code to use. For example, foo.txt can have an EIO error at bytes
34 to 37. There is explicit support for errors such as EAGAIN and EINTR where petardfs
will only report such transient errors a nominated number of times, handy for testing
applications support such IO conditions gracefully.
